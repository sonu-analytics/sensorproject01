 # 🔧 Sensor Fault Detection using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that detects faulty sensors in industrial systems using supervised classification models.  
This solution helps in **predictive maintenance** and ensures better reliability in real-time environments.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Industries rely heavily on sensor data to monitor operations.  
Faulty sensors can mislead the system and cause huge failures or downtime.

This project aims to classify sensor readings into **faulty** or **non-faulty** categories using machine learning techniques.
